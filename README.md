Description:

I completed the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe project during the third week of the GA Software Engineering course. The project focuses on implementing a browser-based game using JavaScript, with minimal use of HTML and CSS for the user interface.

Deployment link:

https://ivanj0rge.github.io/ultimate_tictactoe_project/

Getting Started/Code Installation:

To access the code and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ivanj0rge/ultimate_tictactoe_project
Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
Open the index.html file in your browser to start playing.

Timeframe & Working Team:

I worked on this project individually within a one-week timeframe.

Technologies Used:

JavaScript
HTML
CSS

Brief:

The project brief was to create a playable Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript. The primary focus was on implementing the game logic and ensuring a responsive user interface.

Planning:

During the planning stage, I created wireframes to outline the game's UI, sketched the initial game flow, and utilized a project management tool (Excalidraw) to plan the development sprint. The planning also involved pseudocode to structure the initial logic flow.

Build/Code Process:

I structured the code into modular functions for improved readability and maintainability. Here are snippets highlighting key sections:

// Function to initialize the game board
function initializeGameBoard() {
    // Code for initialization...
}

// Function to check for a win in the current mini board
function checkSmallBoardWin(smallBoard) {
    // Code for win checking...
}

// Event listener for user moves
function handleMove(cell) {
    // Code for handling user moves...
}

Challenges:

A technical challenge was managing the complexity of game logic for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.
Problem-solving involved breaking down the logic into smaller, manageable functions and thorough testing.

Wins:

Successfully implemented a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
Achieved a clean and modular code structure for better maintainability.

Key Learnings/Takeaways:

Improved proficiency in JavaScript and gained a deeper understanding of game logic.
Enhanced problem-solving skills by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components.

Bugs:

No significant bugs to report.

Future Improvements:

Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
Enhance the user interface with animations and additional styling.
Add a scoring system and save game state functionality.
